Modelling Assortative Mating in ASD
====

Some scientists, notably Simon Baron-Cohen of Cambridge, have suggested that autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a disease of high-systemizers; that is, people whose minds attempt to systematize their surroundings much more than normal individuals.  These systemizing traits are thought to be very polygenic, and thus present in the non-ASD population on a wide spectrum.  This project aims to model a scenarion in which non-ASD systemizing traits are subject to increasing decgrees of assortative mating.  The aim is to show how assortative mating could affect the distribution of both high-systemizing traits and ASD through the population.
